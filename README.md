# Task Tracker Backend API 🚀

Welcome to the Task Tracker Backend API repository! This robust backend is the powerhouse behind our Task Tracker application, designed to handle all the data management and security necessary for a seamless user experience. 🛡️💾

## Features 🌟

Our backend provides a comprehensive set of features, including:

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login processes to keep user data safe. 🔐
- **Task Management**: APIs to create, update, delete, and fetch tasks, allowing users to manage their daily activities efficiently. 📋
- **Prioritization and Sorting**: Functionality to prioritize tasks and retrieve them based on their priority level, ensuring important tasks are always front and center. 🔝
- **Progress Tracking**: Capabilities to mark tasks as complete and track overall progress. ✔️
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale, ensuring the backend can handle a growing number of requests as more users join the Task Tracker community. 📈

## Getting Started 🛠️

To get the backend up and running, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed. Follow these steps:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-tracker-backend
npm install
npm start
```

When server will start, go in the MainRuner, uncomment the save methos, so it will fill your db with avatars choosable as profile image from users. After that, comment them again, and you can begin making requests to `http://localhost:3001/`.
